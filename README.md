## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   Run the following command in the `demo` directory to install all required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

   This will also trigger the `prepare` script, which configures git to use the custom hooks located in the `.git-hooks` directory by setting the `core.hooksPath` property.

2. **Git commit hooks**

   The custom git hooks help enforce commit message standards and other repository rules automatically.

3. **Making commits**

   While you can manually write commit messages, it is highly recommended to use the interactive commit tool:

   ```bash
   npm run commit
   ```

   This will guide you through a series of questions to help you compose a properly formatted commit message. This tool can only be access while within the same directory as the `package.json` file.

4. **Commit message requirements**

   The repository enforces a strict commit message policy via `commitlint`. Every commit message **must include a reference** (such as an issue number or identifier, e.g. `#` or `issue-`). This is mandatory and enforced by the configurationâ€”neither manual commits nor the interactive commit tool (`npm run commit`) can bypass this requirement.

   If your commit message does not include a reference, the commit will be rejected.
